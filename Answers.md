1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

<!--  React js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces -->

<!-- React also allows us to create reusable UI components. ... React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. -->

1. What does it mean to think in react?
<!-- React is, in my opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. -->

1. Describe state.
<!-- State is a JavaScript object that stores a component's dynamic data and determines the component's behaviour. -->

1. Describe props.
<!-- Props is an object which stores the value. -->

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

<!-- Side effects are basically anything that affects something outside of the scope of the current function that's being executed.
...
By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates.
